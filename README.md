# LLM-Geolocation-Variability
Reproducible pilot for evaluating geolocation-driven variability in LLM outputs. 3 vendors × 6 endpoints × 20 prompts = 360 runs. Logs refusal (F2), framing/verbosity (F3), and toxicity/moderation (T2). Includes VPN orchestration stubs, annotation rubric, figures, and a minimal execution pack for multi-region API tests.
